    intro: "<p>However, every year, governments, individuals, and corporations ask us to disclose user data.

But when we do have data, we carefully evaluate every request before considering disclosure. If the requests do not meet our <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Requests_for_user_information_procedures_%26_guidelines'>standards</a>—if they are overly broad, unclear, or irrelevant—we will push back on behalf of our users.</p><p>If we must produce information due to a legally valid request, we will <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Requests_for_user_information_procedures_%26_guidelines#Notifying_Our_Users_of_Your_Request'>notify the affected user</a> before we disclose, if we are <a href='/faq.html#nonpublic_personal_information'>legally permitted and have the means</a> to do so.

    story_emergency_body: "Our community shares threats with the Foundation when they find them. When an anonymous poster made an alleged bomb threat, we found that the edit was made from an <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address'>IP address</a> that was near the apparent threat location. As permitted by our privacy policy, we alerted local police, passing on the IP address and details we had about the threat. The police informed us they had located and arrested the person in question, who allegedly had weapons available and reportedly confessed."

    story_whitehouse_title: "Revealing Presidential Threats"
    story_whitehouse_body: "On rare occasions we discover threats against public figures. This is uncommon, but something that happens on large websites. An individual had made specific, graphic threats against President <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama'>Barack Obama</a>. This is contrary to our policies, and against U.S. law. In cases of potential serious harm to a person, our <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy#To_Protect_You.2C_Ourselves_.26_Others'>privacy policy</a> allows us to disclose relevant information. We immediately took action, reporting the user’s <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address'>IP address</a>, <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent'>user agent information</a>, and email address to the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service'>United States Secret Service</a>."

A female <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebes_crested_macaque'>crested black macaque monkey</a> got ahold of the camera and took a series of pictures, including some self-portraits. The pictures were featured in an online newspaper article and eventually posted to <a href='//commons.wikimedia.org/'>Commons</a>. We received a takedown request from the photographer, claiming that he owned the copyright to the photographs. We didn't agree, so we denied the request."
    story3_title: "Aboriginal Language<br><small>July 2012</small>"
    story3_body: "A Tasmanian aboriginal language center demanded the removal of the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org'>English Wikipedia</a> <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palawa_kani'>article on 'palawa kani'</a>, claiming copyright over the entirety of the language. We refused to remove the article because copyright law simply cannot be used to stop people from using an entire language or to prevent general discussion about the language. Such a broad claim would have chilled free speech and negatively impacted research, education, and public discourse—activities that Wikimedia serves to promote."

    story_myanmar_title: "Unredacted<br><small>August 2014</small>"
    story_myanmar_body: "When a blogger included a photo of his visa to visit <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma#Etymology'>Burma/Myanmar</a> on his website, he had scrubbed his personal details from the image. He never expected the same picture to show up on <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> in an article about the country's visa policy -- with the redactions removed and his information exposed. He wrote to us, asking to remove the photo. Given the nature of the information and the circumstances of how it was exposed, we took the image down."

    story_coffee_title: "Grounds for Removal<br><small>July 2014</small>"
    story_coffee_body: "A nutritional supplement company requested the removal of all references to the term “coffee berries” from the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> article on <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee'>coffee</a>, claiming both inaccuracy and infringement of their trademark, COFFEEBERRY&reg;. We responded that the community of editors felt that “coffee berry” was an acceptable term to refer to the fruit of the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea'>coffee plant</a>. We also explained that trademarking a pre-existing word cannot prevent others from using the word for its original meaning. Trademark rights simply don’t give companies total control over everyday words."

    story_seer_title: "A Murky Future<br><small>October 2014</small>"
    story_seer_body: "A law firm representing an astrologer asked that we remove a <a href='//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Accueil_principal'>French Wikipedia</a> article that chronicled her history of allegedly false predictions. Unusually, they cited Wikipedia’s own <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons'>policy on biographies of living persons</a> as a source of the article’s problems. We explained that the Wikimedia Foundation does not write or edit Wikipedia articles. We asked that they engage with the French Wikipedia community of volunteer editors and follow Wikipedia policies to address any issues of alleged inaccuracies with the community. "

    story_dmca_title: "Doubling Down on DMCA<br><small>December 2014</small>"
    story_dmca_body: "Takedown notices play an important role in guarding against copyright infringement. However, there must be transparency surrounding the use of takedown notices, which is why we post the notices we receive on a <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Category:DMCA'>dedicated page</a> and report them to <a href='//chillingeffects.org'>Chilling Effects</a>. In a totally absurd twist, we received a DMCA takedown notice to remove a previously filed DMCA takedown notice from the same individual. The sender also claimed that the second DMCA notice itself was subject to copyright and could not be posted. We declined the request and posted it as we would any other DMCA takedown notice."

    story_mistake_title: "A Common(s) Mistake<br><small>July 2014</small>"
    story_mistake_body: "When a photographer uploaded his photograph to Flickr, he knew that he was making it available for public view, but he didn’t intend for anyone to be able to copy it, and he didn’t license it for reuse. When he found it on <a href='//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>, he sent us a DMCA takedown notice letting us know that it had been uploaded to Commons without his permission. After investigating, we determined that he really did own the image and had not licensed it for reuse on Flickr or elsewhere. We therefore removed the image."

    story_studio_title: "No Take Backsies<br><small>September 2014</small>"
    story_studio_body: "A public relations company demanded that we remove an image of a rapper. However, the photo had been freely licensed under <a href='//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a> policy apparently by the artist and claimed holder of the copyright. Therefore, we declined to remove it. The PR company initially alleged that the portrayed musician was someone different from the rapper. They later appeared to suggest that the rapper had never intended to give his permission. As the story seemed to change, the community examined, and then re-examined, the original permission. In the end the community found that the image should be kept."

We believe that denying people access to relevant and neutral information is antagonistic to the values of the Wikimedia movement and have made a <a href='//blog.wikimedia.org/2014/08/06/european-court-decision-punches-holes-in-free-knowledge/'>statement</a> opposing the decision.</p><p>However, under the theory of the 'right to be forgotten', we have started receiving direct requests to remove content from Wikimedia projects.*</p><p><small>* Please note that this information only reflects requests made directly to us.

We have a dedicated page where we post the notices about attempts to remove links to Wikimedia projects that we have received from the search engines who provide such notices as part of their own commitments to transparency.  But we suspect that many search engines are not even giving notice, which we find contrary to core principles of free expression, due process, and transparency.</small></p>"

  faq:
    title: "Frequently<br>Asked Questions"
    q_information: "What sort of information gets requested?"
    a_information: "<p>All sorts of identifying information, public and nonpublic, gets requested. Requests tend to be broad in nature, in order to capture as much information as possible. However, because we collect relatively <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy#Types_of_Information_We_Receive_From_You.2C_How_We_Get_It.2C_.26_How_We_Use_It'>small amounts of information</a> and retain it for <a href='//meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_retention_guidelines'>limited amounts of time</a>, we frequently have little to disclose.</p>"
    q_standards: "Does WMF have different standards depending on who is requesting?"
    a_standards: "<p>No. Regardless of who is requesting user data—be it an individual, a government, or a law enforcement officer—we typically do not produce information as a result of a request unless we have received proper legal process. More information can be found in our <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Requests_for_user_information_procedures_%26_guidelines'>Requests for User Information Procedure &amp; Guidelines</a>.</p>"
    q_request_abroad: "What happens when you receive a request from abroad?"
    a_request_abroad: "<p>Per our <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Requests_for_user_information_procedures_%26_guidelines'>Requests for User Information Procedure &amp; Guidelines</a>, we require that requests originating from outside of the United States to follow the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_Legal_Assistance_Treaty'>mutual legal assistance treaty</a> (MLAT) process or <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_rogatory'>letters rogatory</a> process so that a U.S. court will issue the required U.S. legal process to the Wikimedia Foundation.</p>"
    q_nonpublic_personal_information: "When would you not tell a user that his or her nonpublic personal information is being disclosed as a result of a legal process, such as a subpoena?"
    a_nonpublic_personal_information: "<p>We are committed to notifying users if we plan on disclosing nonpublic personal information. However, we cannot notify a user if we are legally restrained from doing so (e.g. by a gag order), if a credible threat to life or limb is present, or if the user has not provided us with an e-mail address or valid contact information.</p>"
    q_my_personal_information: "Help! My personal information is being sought because of something I did on the Wikimedia projects. What should I do?"
    a_my_personal_information: "<p>If you are the subject of a subpoena, it is highly recommended that you consult your own lawyer immediately. There are a number of organizations that will fight on a user's behalf, like the <a href='https://www.aclu.org/'>American Civil Liberties Union</a> (ACLU) or the <a href='https://www.eff.org/'>Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF). If you need help finding an attorney, WMF may be able to put you in touch with some of these organizations or help you secure an attorney at reduced or pro-bono rates. In rare cases, assistance may also be available under our <a href='//meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Legal_and_Community_Advocacy/Legal_Fees_Assistance_Program'>Legal Fees Assistance Program</a> or <a href='//meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Legal_and_Community_Advocacy/Legal_Policies#Defense_of_Contributors'>Defense of Contributors Program</a>.</p><p>Additionally, in certain situations, WMF may challenge a subpoena on a user’s behalf if it is unnecessarily broad or burdensome, or if we believe the subpoena threatens the free speech of users on our projects. For more information about subpoenas, see our <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy/Subpoena_FAQ'>Subpoena FAQ</a>. </p>"
    q_information_produced: "What do you mean by 'information produced'?"
    a_information_produced: "When we say 'information produced', we mean that as a result of a legal process (such as a subpoena) that was legally valid, some or all of the nonpublic user information requested by that legal process was produced by WMF to the requesting party.‘Information produced’ also applies to rare situations where we voluntarily disclose personal information to law enforcement, usually in order to prevent imminent bodily harm or death."
    q_informal_non_government_requests: "What do you mean by 'informal non-government requests'?"
    a_informal_non_government_requests: "When we say 'informal non-government requests', we mean a request for user information from a non-governmental entity that does not involve a formal legal process. For example, this would include a situation where a corporation sends us a letter or an email requesting nonpublic information about one of our users."
    q_informal_government_requests: "What do you mean by 'informal government requests'?"
    a_informal_government_requests: "When we say 'informal government requests', we mean a request for user information from a governmental entity that does not involve a formal legal process. For example, this would include a situation where a government sends us a letter or an email requesting nonpublic information about one of our users."
    q_civil_subpoena: "What do you mean by 'civil subpoena'?"
    a_civil_subpoena: "<p>When we say 'civil subpoena', we mean a legal process received by the Wikimedia Foundation from a third-party individual or organization requesting nonpublic user information, that usually relates to a legal dispute between two or more individuals or organizations. Civil subpoenas generally do not require review by a judge or a magistrate.</p>"
    q_criminal_subpoena: "What do you mean by 'criminal subpoena'?"
    a_criminal_subpoena: "<p>When we say 'criminal subpoena', we mean a legal process received by the Wikimedia Foundation requesting nonpublic user information that is typically issued by a government attorney or <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_jury'>grand jury</a>, in connection with an official criminal investigation.</p>"
    q_search_warrant: "What do you mean by 'search warrant'?"
    a_search_warrant: "<p>When we say a 'search warrant', we mean a warrant issued under the procedures of the <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcrmp'>Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure</a> or equivalent state warrant procedures, based upon a showing of <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probable_cause'>probable cause</a> that specific information held by the Wikimedia Foundation may be related to a crime. Search warrants are generally reviewed by a judge or a magistrate.</p>"
    q_court_order: "What do you mean by 'court order'?"
    a_court_order: "<p>When we say 'court order', we mean an order issued by a U.S. court of competent jurisdiction directed at the Wikimedia Foundation. Court orders for user data may be issued under various U.S. federal and state laws, such as section 2703(d) of the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECPA'>Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> ('ECPA'), a federal privacy law. </p><p>For the avoidance of doubt, we believe a warrant is required by the <a href='http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/fourth_amendment'>4th Amendment</a> to the <a href='http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html'>United States Constitution</a>, which prohibits unreasonable search and seizure and overrides conflicting provisions in the ECPA. We believe that the ECPA needs to be updated so that equivalent protections are granted to electronic communications and documents that have already been granted to the physical documents one keeps at home or in their office. To that end, we are a member of the <a href='http://digitaldueprocess.org/index.cfm?objectid=37940370-2551-11DF-8E02000C296BA163'>Digital Due Process Coalition</a> to help in that effort.</p>"
    q_national_security_request: "What do you mean by 'national security request'?"
    a_national_security_request: "'National security requests' include <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter'>national security letters</a> and orders issued under the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Act'>Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act</a>."
    q_potentially_affected: "What do you mean by user accounts potentially affected?"
    a_potentially_affected: "<p>This number represents the number of unique user accounts implicated by requests for user data and whose data would have been disclosed if we have granted every request we received. This number may not reflect the number of unique individuals implicated by requests for user data; if an individual has multiple accounts across all Wikimedia projects, and we receive requests for more than one of these accounts, we record each user account separately. As a result, this number might overestimate the number of individuals implicated by user data requests.</p>"
    q_actually_affected: "What do you mean by user accounts actually affected?"
    a_actually_affected: "<p>This number represents the number of unique user accounts whose nonpublic information was disclosed as a result of WMF receiving a valid request for user data. This number may not reflect the number of unique individuals whose data was disclosed as a result of a valid request for user data; if an individual has multiple accounts across all Wikimedia projects, and we receive requests for more than one of these accounts, we record each user account separately. As a result, this number might overestimate the number of individuals implicated by user data requests.</p>"
    q_voluntary_disclosure: "What do you mean by 'voluntary disclosure'?"
    a_voluntary_disclosure: "When we say ‘voluntary disclosure’, we mean just that: times where we voluntarily—and on our own initiative—disclose personal information to a law enforcement agency. Such disclosures are rare, and we typically make them in emergency situations, such as when we receive a credible suicide threat or threat of physical violence. We only make these disclosures in accordance with the exceptions outlined in our <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy#sharing'>Privacy Policy</a>, such as to protect you, ourselves, and others from imminent and serious bodily harm or death."
    q_right_forgotten: "What do you mean by 'Right to be Forgotten'?"
    a_right_forgotten: "The so-called <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten'>Right to be Forgotten (RTBF)</a> is a legal principle in the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union'>European Union</a> and Argentina. The term reached the mainstream in 2014 when a European court decision, Google Spain v. AEPD and Mario Costeja González, granted EU individuals the ability to request that search engines “de-index” content about them.
While Wikimedia’s projects are not search engines, we occasionally receive requests to remove content based on the RTBF. We began documenting such requests in July, 2014. To learn more about the problems with RTBF and other kinds of censorship, please check out our <a href='//blog.wikimedia.org/2014/08/06/european-court-decision-punches-holes-in-free-knowledge/'>statement</a>."
    q_different_compare: "Why are requests for user data calculated differently by WMF as compared to other organizations?"
    a_different_compare: "In this transparency report, WMF has included all types of requests for user information it receives, including governmental and non-governmental requests as well as informal and formal requests. Other organizations, particularly those appearing in the 'Compared to other companies' graph in our report, only disclose requests originating from governments. Please visit the transparency reports of <a href='https://govtrequests.facebook.com/'>Facebook</a>, <a href='//www.google.com/transparencyreport/'>Google</a>, <a href='https://transparency.twitter.com/'>Twitter</a>, and <a href='//www.linkedin.com/legal/transparency'>LinkedIn</a> for more detail about the types of requests they receive."
    q_public_information_included: "Are requests for public information included in requests for user data?"
    a_public_information_included: "<p>No, any requests for purely publicly available information are not included in this report.</p>"
    q_improve_laws: "What is WMF doing to help improve laws related to disclosure or surveillance of user information?"
    a_improve_laws: "<p>Our core <a href='//meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Sue_Gardner/Wikimedia_Foundation_Guiding_Principles'>values</a> of freedom of speech and access to information can be threatened by laws that compromise user privacy. For this reason, the Wikimedia Foundation has joined the fight to improve privacy laws around the world. </p><p>In 2013, we joined the <a href='http://digitaldueprocess.org/index.cfm?objectid=37940370-2551-11DF-8E02000C296BA163'>Digital Due Process Coalition</a> (DDPC), an organization focused on reforming the United States <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Communications_Privacy_Act'>Electronic Communications Privacy Act</a> (ECPA). The ECPA specifies standards for law enforcement access to electronic communications and associated data, thereby providing a degree of privacy to users of digital communication services. However, the ECPA was enacted in 1986, meaning that it does not adequately protect users anymore and only serves to provide inconsistent standards for law enforcement when dealing with 'new' technologies. The DDPC's mission is to simplify, clarify, and unify the ECPA standards—providing clearer privacy protections for users taking into account changes in technology and usage patterns, while preserving the legal tools necessary for government agencies to enforce the laws and protect the public.</p><p>In 2014, <a href='//blog.wikimedia.org/2014/05/09/opposing-mass-surveillance-on-the-internet/'>we signed</a> onto the <a href='//en.necessaryandproportionate.org/take-action/digiges'>Necessary and Proportionate Principles</a>, which strongly support the application of human rights to mass surveillance and set forth basic principles governments should adhere to when employing modern surveillance technologies. We strongly oppose mass surveillance by any government or entity and hope that these principles provide a first step towards improving the practices that are currently being employed.</p>"
    q_resolve_content_disputes: "How do users resolve content disputes and decide what should appear on the Wikimedia projects?"
    a_resolve_content_disputes: "<p>All content on the Wikimedia projects are written, uploaded, edited, and curated by people just like you from around the world. For the most part, users—not the Wikimedia Foundation—develop and enforce the policies and procedures that govern the content on the projects. This means that users decide what should and shouldn't be included on the projects, within the bounds of U.S. law. </p><p>Similarly, each project's community has created policies and procedures to handle disputes about whether certain content belongs on a particular project or meets that project's standards.</p><p>When a third party who, say, has an Wikipedia article written about them and doesn't like some unflattering content included in that article, the proper way to address their concerns is to take it up with the community itself, as opposed to the Wikimedia Foundation.</p>"
    q_im_being_sued: "Help! I'm being sued because of something I did on the Wikimedia projects. What should I do?"
    a_im_being_sued: "<p>Lawsuits against Wikimedia users are exceedingly uncommon—most disputes about content are resolved by working with the user community through community-driven processes. In fact, individuals and organizations that sue over content they wish to remove from the public's eye often end up causing that content to receive greater public attention as a result of the lawsuit, a phenomenon known as the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect'>Streisand Effect</a>.</p><p>In the unlikely event that you are the subject of a lawsuit, it is highly recommended that you consult your own lawyer. There are a number of organizations that fight on a user's behalf, like the <a href='http://www.casp.net/'>California Anti-SLAPP Project</a> or the <a href='https://www.eff.org/'>Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (EFF). If you need help finding an attorney, WMF may be able to put you in touch with some of these organizations or help you secure an attorney at reduced or pro-bono rates. Additionally, in rare cases, assistance may also be available under our <a href='//meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Legal_and_Community_Advocacy/Legal_Fees_Assistance_Program'>Legal Fees Assistance Program</a> or <a href='//meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Legal_and_Community_Advocacy/Legal_Policies#Defense_of_Contributors'>Defense of Contributors Program</a>.</p>"
    q_remove_content: "Does WMF ever remove content?"
    a_remove_content: "<p>Absent the receipt of a legally valid <a href='//www.chillingeffects.org/dmca512/faq.cgi#QID130'>DMCA notice</a>, the Wikimedia Foundation will generally only remove content in exceptional circumstances.For example, we once removed a blogger’s unredacted travel visa after somebody else posted the image with his private information exposed.</p>"
    q_dmca_valid_proper: "What makes a DMCA takedown notice 'valid' or 'proper'?"
    a_dmca_valid_proper: "<p>The DMCA has several <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_Copyright_Infringement_Liability_Limitation_Act#Notice_from_copyright_owner'>formal requirements</a> for notices. However, our evaluation isn’t over when we receive a notice that meets all of these requirements. We will also analyze the copyright eligibility of the work being infringed, whether the allegedly infringing material actually infringes, and whether the allegedly infringing material is a <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use'>fair use</a> of the requester’s work. For more information, see our <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/DMCA_Policy'>DMCA Policy</a>.</p>"
    q_transparent_dmca: "How are you transparent about particular DMCA removals besides in this transparency report?"
    a_transparent_dmca: "<p>We record every DMCA takedown request that results in removal of content on <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Category:DMCA'>our website</a>. In addition, every DMCA removal is submitted to the <a href='//www.chillingeffects.org/'>Chilling Effects Clearinghouse</a> (Chilling Effects), a web archive managed by the <a href='https://www.eff.org/'>Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and several law school clinics. By collecting takedown notices from a variety of sources, Chilling Effects provides a large set of data for analysis and allows recipients and senders of takedown notices to learn more about how the DMCA operates in the current online environment.</p>"
    q_counter_notices: "Did you receive any <a href='//www.chillingeffects.org/question.cgi?QuestionID=132'>DMCA counter-notices</a>?"
    a_counter_notices: "<p>No, we did not receive any DMCA counter-notices between July 2012 - December 2014</p>"
    q_six_month: "Why is the information from July 2012 - June 2013 not available in six-month increments like the information from July 2013 - December 2014?"
    a_six_month: "<p>During the July 2012 - June 2013 period, we recorded totals only for the entire period, rather than breaking the totals into six-month terms. In order to provide a better comparison with other reporting organizations, we changed the date ranges for our charts to line up with those used by those organizations starting in July 2013.</p>"
    q_count_requests: "How do you count requests?"
    a_count_requests: "<p>Each request received counts as one request in the transparency report, irrespective of the number of webpages, content, or users that request deals with. For example, a request for user information that asks for the information of three users counts as one request for user data, and a DMCA takedown request that requests the removal of 5 images is counted as one DMCA request. Duplicate requests regarding the same matter from the same requesting party are also counted as one request. For example, if a requesting party sends us multiple demand letters to take a particular Wikipedia article down, it counts as one request.</p>"
    q_targeted_takedown: "What do you mean when you say a project was 'targeted' by a takedown, alteration, or DMCA request?"
    a_targeted_takedown: "<p>It means that a particular project would have been altered if we had granted a particular request or that a particular project was actually altered due to a particular request. For example, if the transparency report indicates that French Wiktionary was targeted by one content alteration request, it means that we received a content alteration request that demanded that we change content on French Wiktionary.</p>"
    q_projects_affected: "Do you have data for projects potentially and actually affected from July 2012 to June 2013?"
    a_projects_affected: "<p>No, we started tracking requests in more detail beginning in July 2013, so this level of detail is not available for July 2012 to June 2013.</p>"
