    <h3>Grounds for Removal<br><small>July 2014</small></h3>
    <p>A nutritional supplement company requested the removal of all references to the term “coffee berries” from the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> article on <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee'>coffee</a>, claiming both inaccuracy and infringement of their trademark, COFFEEBERRY&reg;. We responded that the community of editors felt that “coffee berry” was an acceptable term to refer to the fruit of the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea'>coffee plant</a>. We also explained that trademarking a pre-existing word cannot prevent others from using the word for its original meaning. Trademark rights simply don’t give companies total control over everyday words.</p>

    <h3>Unredacted<br><small>August 2014</small></h3>
    <p>When a blogger included a photo of his visa to visit <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma#Etymology'>Burma/Myanmar</a> on his website, he had scrubbed his personal details from the image. He never expected the same picture to show up on <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> in an article about the country's visa policy -- with the redactions removed and his information exposed. He wrote to us, asking to remove the photo. Given the nature of the information and the circumstances of how it was exposed, we took the image down.</p>

    <p>A law firm representing an astrologer asked that we remove a <a href='//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikip%C3%A9dia:Accueil_principal'>French Wikipedia</a> article that chronicled her history of allegedly false predictions. Unusually, they cited Wikipedia’s own <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons'>policy on biographies of living persons</a> as a source of the article’s problems. We explained that the Wikimedia Foundation does not write or edit Wikipedia articles. We asked that they engage with the French Wikipedia community of volunteer editors and follow Wikipedia policies to address any issues of alleged inaccuracies with the community. </p>

    <h3>Doubling Down on DMCA<br><small>December 2014</small></h3>
    <p>Takedown notices play an important role in guarding against copyright infringement. However, there must be transparency surrounding the use of takedown notices, which is why we post the notices we receive on a <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Category:DMCA'>dedicated page</a> and report them to <a href='//chillingeffects.org'>Chilling Effects</a>. In a totally absurd twist, we received a DMCA takedown notice to remove a previously filed DMCA takedown notice from the same individual. The sender also claimed that the second DMCA notice itself was subject to copyright and could not be posted. We declined the request and posted it as we would any other DMCA takedown notice.</p>

    <h3>No Take Backsies<br><small>September 2014</small></h3>
    <p>A public relations company demanded that we remove an image of a rapper. However, the photo had been freely licensed under <a href='//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a> policy apparently by the artist and claimed holder of the copyright. Therefore, we declined to remove it. The PR company initially alleged that the portrayed musician was someone different from the rapper. They later appeared to suggest that the rapper had never intended to give his permission. As the story seemed to change, the community examined, and then re-examined, the original permission. In the end the community found that the image should be kept.</p>

    <h3>A Common(s) Mistake<br><small>July 2014</small></h3>
    <p>When a photographer uploaded his photograph to Flickr, he knew that he was making it available for public view, but he didn’t intend for anyone to be able to copy it, and he didn’t license it for reuse. When he found it on <a href='//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>, he sent us a DMCA takedown notice letting us know that it had been uploaded to Commons without his permission. After investigating, we determined that he really did own the image and had not licensed it for reuse on Flickr or elsewhere. We therefore removed the image.</p>

    <h3>A Deadly Threat</h3>
    <p>Our community shares threats with the Foundation when they find them. When an anonymous poster made an alleged bomb threat, we found that the edit was made from an <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address'>IP address</a> that was near the apparent threat location. As permitted by our privacy policy, we alerted local police, passing on the IP address and details we had about the threat. The police informed us they had located and arrested the person in question, who allegedly had weapons available and reportedly confessed.</p>

    <h3>Revealing Presidential Threats</h3>
    <p>On rare occasions we discover threats against public figures. This is uncommon, but something that happens on large websites. An individual had made specific, graphic threats against President <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama'>Barack Obama</a>. This is contrary to our policies, and against U.S. law. In cases of potential serious harm to a person, our <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_policy#To_Protect_You.2C_Ourselves_.26_Others'>privacy policy</a> allows us to disclose relevant information. We immediately took action, reporting the user’s <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address'>IP address</a>, <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_agent'>user agent information</a>, and email address to the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service'>United States Secret Service</a>.</p>

    <h3>Dealing with Suicide</h3>
    <p> Authorities <a href='//www.afsp.org/preventing-suicide/frequently-asked-questions'>advise</a> contacting emergency services when a loved one threatens suicide. When someone shared what appeared to be a credible intent to commit suicide, we notified their local police department. The person was able to get medical help, and later let us know they were okay. If you are considering suicide, please <a href='//www.afsp.org/preventing-suicide/find-help'>seek out a mental health professional immediately</a>. You can also contact emergency services; visit an emergency room or psychiatric walk-in clinic; or call a <a href='//www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres'>suicide prevention hotline</a>.</p>

    <p>A <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_centrale_du_renseignement_int%C3%A9rieur'>French intelligence agency</a> summoned a Wikipedia user to its offices, and threatened him with severe criminal penalties if he did not use his administrative rights to delete information about a <a href='//fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Station_hertzienne_militaire_de_Pierre-sur-Haute'>military base</a> from <a href='//fr.wikipedia.org/'>French Wikipedia</a> that the agency deemed classified.

    <p>A Tasmanian aboriginal language center demanded the removal of the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org'>English Wikipedia</a> <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palawa_kani'>article on 'palawa kani'</a>, claiming copyright over the entirety of the language. We refused to remove the article because copyright law simply cannot be used to stop people from using an entire language or to prevent general discussion about the language. Such a broad claim would have chilled free speech and negatively impacted research, education, and public discourse—activities that Wikimedia serves to promote.</p>

    <p>A publishing company sent us a takedown request concerning four famous works on <a href='//wikisource.org/'>Wikisource</a>: French translations of <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Austen'>Jane Austen's</a> <a href='//fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Les_Cinq_Filles_de_Mrs_Bennet'><em>Pride and Prejudice</em></a> and <a href='//fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Persuasion'><em>Persuasion</em></a>, a French translation of <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Conan_Doyle'>Arthur Conan Doyle's</a> <a href='//fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Les_Aventures_de_Sherlock_Holmes'><em>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</em></a>, and <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_de_la_Fontaine'>Jean de la Fontaine’s</a> <a href='//fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Fables_de_La_Fontaine,_livres_I-III'><em>Fables</em></a>. We immediately noticed the peculiarity with the request: all four original works (and likely their French translations as well) were old enough to have fallen into the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain'>public domain</a>. When we alerted the company to this point, it rescinded the takedown notice.</p>
