    <p>We carefully evaluate every DMCA notice we receive, but the job is easier when the requester provides all of the necessary information. Recently, we complied with two DMCA notices from a stock photo agency. One concerned a photo of a red fox, the other a Nepalese mountain. They also requested a third photo be removed, but as is often the case, the community noticed the improper copyright permissions and proactively removed it before we got the chance to. In each case, the agency had followed the template for DMCA requests, facilitating our review and consequently the removal of their content.</p>

    <p>The Wikimedia community is large and diverse, but has many things in common: for example, who doesn’t like getting a <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars'>barnstar</a> to recognize their good work on the Projects? Unfortunately, we recently received a DMCA request about one of the many barnstar images available across Wikimedia projects. Someone had uploaded a unique 'Home-Made Barnstar' from an arts and crafts site without permission to use the star. We evaluated the request, and removed the image. Don’t worry, though: you can still get a homemade barnstar. There are freely licensed barnstars, like <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Homemadebarnstar.png'>this one</a>, just waiting to be discovered and awarded.</p>

    <p>Sometimes, we get takedown requests for websites that we do not operate. In most cases, we explain to the requester that they’ve contacted the wrong party, and don’t hear from them again. But recently, a company sent us three separate DMCA requests, asking that we remove certain allegedly proprietary content from our sites. The problem? Wikimedia is not associated with any of the sites in question. The company apparently thought that all sites that include the word 'wiki' in the URL or use <a href='//www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki'>MediaWiki software</a> are Wikimedia projects. We explained that isn't the case, but they continued to send us DMCA notices.</p>

    <p>A user contacted us to express concern about an <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> article on a famous work of art. They wanted to remove a single sentence, on the grounds that the sentence infringed their claimed copyright in a theory they had published some years ago. We explained to them that it is impossible to copyright an idea or a short statement of fact. They could copyright their article, but not the theories contained within. If the community thought the idea was interesting or notable and complied with Wikipedia’s policies, it was free to include it in the article.</p>

As support for their request, they cited a self-publication declaring that the founder of their tradition is the ruler of the universe. We explained that the Wikimedia Foundation does not edit or curate content on Wikipedia, and that if they were concerned about inaccuracies, they could consult Wikipedia's experienced volunteer editors. We also directed them to Wikipedia’s <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability'>policy on verifiability</a> and <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources'>guide to identifying reliable sources</a>, so that they could better understand the standards applied to Wikipedia articles and permissible sources to cite in those articles.</p>

    <p>A lawyer reached out to us on behalf of a lesser-known North American political party that was unhappy with edits to <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> articles about the party and one of its leaders. Her clients apparently wanted previous, more promotional versions of the articles restored in place of the later versions. To better engage in discussions with the community, we encouraged them to familiarize themselves with Wikipedia's <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Writing_better_articles#Information_style_and_tone'>recommendations on style and tone</a> and the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not#Wikipedia_is_not_a_soapbox_or_means_of_promotion'>policy restricting use of promotional language</a>. We also advised that one of the best ways to resolve their concerns is to engage with the community directly.</p>

    <p>A nutritional supplement company requested the removal of all references to the term “coffee berries” from the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> article on <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee'>coffee</a>, claiming both inaccuracy and infringement of their trademark, COFFEEBERRY&reg;. We responded that the community of editors felt that “coffee berry” was an acceptable term to refer to the fruit of the <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffea'>coffee plant</a>. We also explained that trademarking a pre-existing word cannot prevent others from using the word for its original meaning.

    <p>When a blogger included a photo of his visa to visit <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma#Etymology'>Burma/Myanmar</a> on his website, he had scrubbed his personal details from the image. He never expected the same picture to show up on <a href='//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>English Wikipedia</a> in an article about the country's visa policy -- with the redactions removed and his information exposed.

We explained that the Wikimedia Foundation does not write or edit Wikipedia articles. We asked that they engage with the French Wikipedia community of volunteer editors and follow Wikipedia policies to address any issues of alleged inaccuracies with the community. </p>

    <p>Takedown notices play an important role in guarding against copyright infringement. However, there must be transparency surrounding the use of takedown notices, which is why we post the notices we receive on a <a href='//wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Category:DMCA'>dedicated page</a> and report them to <a href='//chillingeffects.org'>Chilling Effects</a>. In a totally absurd twist, we received a DMCA takedown notice to remove a previously filed DMCA takedown notice from the same individual. The sender also claimed that the second DMCA notice itself was subject to copyright and could not be posted. We declined the request and posted it as we would any other DMCA takedown notice.</p>

    <p>A public relations company demanded that we remove an image of a rapper. However, the photo had been freely licensed under <a href='//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a> policy apparently by the artist and claimed holder of the copyright. Therefore, we declined to remove it. The PR company initially alleged that the portrayed musician was someone different from the rapper. They later appeared to suggest that the rapper had never intended to give his permission. As the story seemed to change, the community examined, and then re-examined, the original permission. In the end the community found that the image should be kept.</p>

    <p>When a photographer uploaded his photograph to Flickr, he knew that he was making it available for public view, but he didn’t intend for anyone to be able to copy it, and he didn’t license it for reuse. When he found it on <a href='//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page'>Wikimedia Commons</a>, he sent us a DMCA takedown notice letting us know that it had been uploaded to Commons without his permission. After investigating, we determined that he really did own the image and had not licensed it for reuse on Flickr or elsewhere. We therefore removed the image.</p>
